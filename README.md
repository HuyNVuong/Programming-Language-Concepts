# Programming Language Concepts
* Parser and Lexer : Antlr
* Static and and Dynamic Scoping : Javascript
* Functional programming : Haskell
* Logical Programming : Prolog

# Thoughts
* Antlr is all about regular expression. You work from left to right, top to bottom
* Haskell operations with recursion and LinkedList is incredibly fast
* Prolog part03 was really interesting, as you can implement Breath First Search to cover all of its' cases. However, it was really complicate to get the algorithms to work. Rather, I made a lot of assumption about the correct output of the program and build predicates for it - (40/40).
